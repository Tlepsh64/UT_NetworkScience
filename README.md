# UT_NetworkScience
A repo containing the homeworks of the Network Science course given in the University of Tartu, Spring 2021. Here are some brief information about them:

  Homework 1 is mainly about descriptive graph analysis & visualization. No predictive tasks are performed, the focus is on understanding basic graph properties such as shortest path length, community detection algorithms and visualizing graphs through Networkx and Gephi.
  
  Homework 2 is about using unsupervised graph features such as jaccard index, number of common neighbors, katz ranking etc for link prediction. In addition to this, an introduction to Node2Vec algorithm was conducted as well.
  
  Graph Convolutional Networks were used in Homework 3.
  
  Homework 4 is about constructing knowledge graphs from text data and predicting link attributes using the ComplEX algorithm. 
  
  In the last and shortest homework of the course, we focused on epidemic models.
