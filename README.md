# UT_NetworkScience
A repo containing the homeworks of the Network Science course given in the University of Tartu, Spring 2021. Here are some brief information about them:

**1. Homework 1** is mainly about descriptive graph analysis & visualization. No predictive tasks are performed, the focus is on understanding basic graph properties such as shortest path length, community detection algorithms and visualizing graphs through Networkx and Gephi.
  
**2. Homework 2** is about using unsupervised graph features such as jaccard index, number of common neighbors, katz ranking etc for link prediction. In addition to this, an introduction to Node2Vec algorithm was conducted as well.
  
3. Graph Convolutional Networks and GraphSAGE were used in **Homework 3** for classifying the nodes in the cora dataset.
  
**4. Homework 4** is about constructing knowledge graphs from text & tabular data. We then used several KG embedding algorithms(ComplEX, TransE and HoIE) and compared their performance using several metrics, such as mean reciprocal rank. The best performing KG embeddings were used for a prediction task on the original tabular dataset.
  
5. In the last and shortest homework of the course, we focused on epidemic models.
